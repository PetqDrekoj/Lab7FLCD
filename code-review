	Code Review :

Main.java
Simple , nothing to comment

Grammar.java
Well structured , easy to read code

MyScanner.java
Well documented , scan function a bit too long , maybe could have been broken down into multiple functions
Good usages of regexes
line 264 romanian in printing although english has been used throughout the project output

SymbolTableNode.java
A few functions never used

ThreePair.java
Inconsistent naming conflicting with MyPair.java
Good usage of additional functions like MyPair and ThreePair
